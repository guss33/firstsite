        <p><strong>Get Things Done on-time... Everyday!</strong></p>
        <p>5Things helps you get things done by limiting your to-do list to 5 items, so you're forced to focus only on the most important things.</p>
        <p><strong>How It Works:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Add the 5 most-important things you need to do to 5Things</li>
            <li>Start with #1 and</li>
            <li>Don't stop until you're done (except for breaks)</li>
            
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Do this and you'll never have an unproductive day again.</strong></p>
